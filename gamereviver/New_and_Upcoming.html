              Today games have reached that platform where it is known as video games, yes that`s correct and has 
              gain the ability to tell a story as though you are watching a movie.
              Some of those games has reached a simulator level where you, drive a car, fly a plane as though you are 
              doing it in real life.</p>
            <p>
                Truth be told, you can actually do anything imaginary on a video game today.
                Most of the new releases focuses on graphics on game playability.
                Even if a game doesn`t wind up landing every punch, I imagine that
                its constant surprises will be enough to keep me interested in its promising fullfillment.
                I`ll take some  creative swings from a  studio over that has a great genre piece any time.
                Some of those creative swings, almost all of them has online gaming available, which in turn makes 
                it more worthwhile to play.

          There are a few games that turned heads when it came to graphics and performance.
          Here are three of those games:</h2>

          <h3>Hogwarts Legacy</h3>
            <p>
            Even better, though, is the world itself, it is just packed with nearly everything I wanted in a 
            Potter game and more. 
            You`ll find yourself exploring Hogwarts stone-cobbled halls and secret passageways, 
            you  can fly around the Forbidden Forest on a broomstick, 
            and explore dark caves lit only by the glow of your Lumos spell. 
            The  game  brilliantly captured the look and feel of the Wizarding World of Hogwarts 
            that amazed me , no matter what trivial errand they had me wrapped up in.

          <h2>Deadspace Remake</h2>
          <p>
            One of the best horror games, that ive played this far with jaw dropping graphics and out of 
            this world story line.
            Gameplay is intense and can be be set in the options menu to suite you level.
            Deadspace remake takes you into a dark space sci-fi environment with creatures that jumps out of nowhere 
            to give you the chills and fright your life.
